Presented by: Rachel Edwards, Svitlana Glibova

## Overview
Our project takes a look at the factors that gp into determinig if water points in Tanzania are functional or not. We hope to build a tool through statistical analysis and modeling that can accurately predict the functionality of one of these water points. These predictions will help us better serve the needs of the Tanzanian Ministry of Argirculture, Food Securtiy and Cooperatives as the contiune to try and supply Tanzania with clean safe water. 


## Business Problem
Over 50% of Tanzania's GDP rely on livestock and agriculture while 80% of employment is directly related to those fields. These water pumps are used by thousands all over Tanzania and the management of these water resources are vital to the citizens of Tanzania. Our goal is to provied the Ministry with a way to predict whether a certain pump is functioning, while optimizing for the least amount of false positives. False positives, predicting that pump is safe and working when in reality it isn't, could be potentially dangerous to the citizens of Tanzania and costly for the government.


## Data
The data for our project has been collected and curated by [Taarifa](http://taarifa.org/) and the [Tanzanian Ministry of Water](https://www.maji.go.tz/). It consists of 39 possible contributing factors for our predictions that include geographical data about Tanzania and its basins, who funds and manages these water pumps, how they are paid for and the populations that rely on them for safe clean water. The files and instruction on how to access them can be located in the data folder. Documentation for the data set can be found [Here](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/7/pump-it-up-data-mining-the-water-table/page/25/)


## Methods
The methods used for this analysis start with exploratory data analysis where we look for correlations between the data and target and clean and pre-process our data. We then use folium to produce geographically accurate maps of Tanzania to privide visualizations of the data. We also use statistical modeling to make predictions based on our EDA and an iterative model tuning process.
